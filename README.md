# Sublime Text Github Search plugin

A plugin to search github code and issues.

#Usage

On any piece of code, highlight it and press ctrl+alt+g. Alernatively, select `Github Code Search` when right-clicking on any selected code. For searching github issues, select `Github Issue Search` after right-clicking.


#Future work

Currently, the results open in a new browser. In the next version, the results should appear in sublime text. More sophisticated searching, such as language-specific searches, will be supported soon.
